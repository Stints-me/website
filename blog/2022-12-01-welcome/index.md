Hey, merry Christmas, and welcome to **Stints.me**

**Stints.me** is an exciting new To-Do App.
For now the app has several awesome & elegant features, some of which are listed here:

- **Projects** & **Areas** (to separate stints by assignments)
- **Tags** support
- **Search** functionality
- **Theming** options
- **Gestures** for easier & faster stint management
- **Dates** for deadlines and due dates
- **Notifications** get notifications for ToDoâ€™s with due dates
- **Widgets** Both Home Screen and Lock Screen widgets (iOS)

The first goal(-s) for now is to get this app out on iOS & iPad, but there are also plans to release it to macOS.

But first I want to get this app out to you, the users. This will still take some time, but I hope to get it out in the next month or so.

see you soon!
